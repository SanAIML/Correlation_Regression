# Software required :  

Python

# Theory:

Correlation describes the strength of an association between two variables, and is completely symmetrical, the correlation between A and B is the same as the correlation between B and A. However, if the two variables are related it means that when one changes by a certain amount the other changes on an average by a certain amount.  

If y represents the dependent variable and x the independent variable, this relationship is described as the regression of y on x. The relationship can be represented by a simple equation called the regression equation. The regression equation representing how much y changes with any given change of x can be used to construct a regression line on a scatter diagram, and in the simplest case this is assumed to be a straight line.

# Result
```
Enter the values of X separated by space
25 28 35 32 31 36 29 38 34 32
Enter the values of Y separated by space
43 46 49 41 36 32 31 30 33 39
[25 28 35 32 31 36 29 38 34 32]
[43 46 49 41 36 32 31 30 33 39]
10
The Regression Y on X is Y = -0.664 ( X - 32.000) + 38.000
